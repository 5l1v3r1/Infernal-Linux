# Infernal-Linux

This is the Linux Distribution which I created to aid the wireless penetration tester to utilize during the assessment. 
The distribution contains Infernal Wireless Suite and aircrack-ng to perform all needed activities. 
The most important part is WPA2 Enterprise Hacking is working which it is hard to get to work on Kali 2. 
I have set up all needed prerequisites which would let the users to start assessing the network.

Thank you Offensive Security!
